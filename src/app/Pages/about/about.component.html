              Angular Developer with 2 years of experience developing and managing complex web applications using
              Angular, Node.js, and JavaScript. Proven track record of creating intuitive, high-performance, user-friendly  applications and
              websites with exceptional front-end and back-end development skills. Highly experienced in the full application
              development life cycle, from initial development to deployment and maintenance. Well-versed in Agile methodology and
              cross-browser compatibility. Skilled at troubleshooting, debugging, and optimizing applications.
              One of the projects that I have built with Angular is a web application to help companies manage their
              customer relationships. The application was used to create and manage customer accounts, track sales opportunities,
              and  analyze customer data. The application was built using Angular components and services to enable a custom
              user experience. The application was also configured to integrate with a CRM system for data storage, and was
              designed to be flexible and easily expandable. The application was successfully deployed and is currently in use by
              multiple companies.
